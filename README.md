# Text:
Yellow text signifies a character. Green text refers to player character. Blue text signifies a tutorial or decision. Red text signifies an important decision that will change the ending (doesn't count death endings).

# Endings:
There are 2 major routes you can take in Chapter 1. You can stay with Tot, the patroller, or join the Highway Guard with Hunter. To get the true "good" ending, you must play two routes in order (Tot (leave ending) and Hunter (leave ending)). To not die, simply shoot the mimics in the chest. There is no combat system in this game.

Patrol/Tot – exit ending

Choose to stay with Tot in Chapter 1. Remember the password you get when you reach the map room in the library. Run for the computer when facing President. When prompted, enter the password. If correct, will unlock the leave ending for Tot route.

Patrol/Tot – stay ending

Do the same as the exit ending, but don't run for the computer. This will unlock the stay ending for Tot route.

Guard/Hunter – leave ending

Choose to leave and join the Highway Guard in chapter 1. Don’t take the stairs when you enter the lookout building. Instead, take investigate the strange room. You'll learn the location of the detonator, unlocking the leave ending for Hunter route.

Guard/Hunter – stay ending

Choose to leave and join the highway guards in chapter 1. Take the stairs when asked. You will not find the map. This unlocks the stay ending for Hunter route.

“True” ending

Choose to stay with Tot in Chapter 1. Get the exit ending. Return to the title screen, but do not exit the game. Replay the game, this time playing the Hunter route. The decision to enter the strange room does not matter. When prompted, enter the password. Even if you know the password, the flag wont unlock unless you got the Tot exit ending (Or just entered the code in the title screen, but that's cheating). This will unlock the "True" ending.

# Extra features:
Entering “debug” in the title screen will allow the user to start the game from a certain chapter number. Useful for testing chapters without having to restart the entire game.
Entering "remember" in the title screen will instantly unlock the flag for the true ending. This changes some dialogue in the beginning.
If name field is left empty when asked, Tot will name the player. This alters certain dialogue but does not effect ending.
